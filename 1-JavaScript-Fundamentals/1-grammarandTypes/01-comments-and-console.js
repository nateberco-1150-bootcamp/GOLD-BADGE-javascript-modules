//console.log and debugging
//we can debug with console.log messages in 2 big ways:
//1) we can check the status of some javascrupt 'thing'
//2) we can check a process we have built with repeated console.log messages

//example 1:
var sampleName = "Tyler";
console.log(sampleName);

//example 2:
var sampleNum = 1;
console.log(sampleNum);
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum);
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum);
